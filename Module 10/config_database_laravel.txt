Environment Configuration-


Instead of hardcoding database connection details directly into config/database.php,
you can also use environment variables. Laravel supports this out of the box. 
 
> Create a .env file in the root directory of your Laravel application if it doesn't already exist.

> Add your database connection details to the .env file using the format 

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3307
DB_DATABASE=database_name
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

***********************************************

> Inside the connections array, you'll find configurations for different database connections. 
The default connection is usually set to mysql. 
>Set the database connection parameters according to your database setup. 

>These parameters typically include: 
* driver: The database driver (e.g., mysql, sqlite, pgsql). 
* host: The host of your database server (e.g., localhost). 
* port: The port your database server is running on (e.g., 3306 for MySQL). 
* database: The name of the database you want to connect to. 
* username: The username for the database connection. 
* password: The password for the database connection. 
* charset: The character set used by the database. 
* collation: The collation used by the database. 
* prefix: The prefix applied to table names (optional).
