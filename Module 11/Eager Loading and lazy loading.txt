Q. What is Eager Loading and lazy loading? 

Eager loading and lazy loading are two approaches used in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks like Laravel's Eloquent to retrieve and load related data from the database.

1. Eager Loading: 
> Eager loading is a technique where you retrieve all related data along with the main data in a single database query. 
> It's beneficial when you know in advance that you will need the related data, as it reduces the number of database queries required. 
> In Eloquent, you can eager load relationships using the with method. 

For example:

$posts = Post::with('comments')->get();

> This retrieves all posts along with their comments in a single query, rather than retrieving posts first and then querying for comments for each post separately.

2. lazy loading:
>Lazy loading is a technique where related data is only loaded from the database when it's explicitly accessed. 
>It's useful when you're not sure whether you'll need the related data, as it avoids unnecessary database queries. 
>In Eloquent, relationships are typically set up to lazily load by default. 

For example:

$post = Post::find(1);
$comments = $post->comments; // This triggers a query to load comments for the post

> Here, comments are only loaded when $post->comments is accessed.


************************************

>> Comparison: 

* Eager loading reduces the number of database queries but may fetch more data than necessary. 
* Lazy loading loads related data on-demand, which can be more efficient if you don't always need the related data. 
* Eager loading is suitable for scenarios where you know you'll need the related data, while lazy loading is better when the need for related data is uncertain.
