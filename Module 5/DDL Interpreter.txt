A database management system (DBMS) component called a DDL (Data Definition Language) interpreter is in charge of interpreting and carrying out commands pertaining to the creation and alteration of database schema objects. Tables, views, constraints, and indexes are examples of database objects that can be created, modified, and removed using DDL commands.


Among a DDL interpreter's main duties are:

Parsing: To comprehend the syntax and semantics of the DDL statements sent by users or applications, the DDL interpreter parses the statements. It dissects the claims into coherent parts and confirms that they are true.

Validation: Following the parsing of the DDL statements, the interpreter verifies that they adhere to the limitations and guidelines specified by the database schema and the DBMS. This entails examining data types, object names, integrity restrictions, and syntax problems.


Execution: The DDL interpreter runs the DDL statements to carry out the specified database schema operations after they have been validated. Database objects may need to be created, modified, or dropped in accordance with the DDL commands.


Management of Transactions: DDL commands usually function inside a transaction. The DDL interpreter is responsible for overseeing transactional features like durability, atomicity, and isolation to guarantee the accuracy and consistency of database modifications.

Metadata Management: The DDL interpreter updates the system catalog, also known as the data dictionary, which contains metadata about database objects, when DDL instructions change the database schema. This metadata contains details about ownership, constraints, data types, and object names.


Concurrency Control: To manage concurrent DDL operations from different users or sessions, the DDL interpreter may implement concurrency control techniques in multi-user database settings. This guarantees the consistent and segregated execution of DDL operations.

All things considered, the DDL interpreter is essential to allowing users and applications to specify and control the database's structure, guaranteeing that modifications to the schema are applied precisely and effectively while preserving consistency and integrity of the data.
