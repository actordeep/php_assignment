    <h2>Q.1 What is software? What is software engineering?</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Software:</b> It's the set of instructions that tell a computer what to
      do.<br />
      This can include anything from basic operating systems to the applications
      and games we use every day.<br /><br />
      <b>Software Engineering:</b> This is the disciplined approach to
      developing software. <br />It involves using engineering principles to
      design, develop, test, and maintain software,<br />
      ensuring it meets high standards of quality and reliability.
    </p>
    <h2>Q.2 Explain types of software?</h2>
    <p>
      <b>1. System Software:</b> Controls the hardware and provides a platform
      for running application software. <br />Examples include operating systems
      like Windows, macOS, and Linux. <br /><br />
      <b>2. Application Software:</b> Performs specific tasks for users.
      Examples include word processors (like Microsoft Word), <br />web browsers
      (like Google Chrome), and photo editing software (like Adobe Photoshop).
      <br /><br />
      <b>3. Utility Software:</b> Provides tools to help manage, maintain, and
      protect the computer system. <br />Examples include antivirus software,
      disk cleaners, and backup programs. <br /><br />
      <b>4. Programming Software:</b> Assists programmers in creating,
      debugging, and maintaining other software. <br />Examples include
      compilers, interpreters, and integrated development environments (IDEs).
      <br /><br />
      <b>5. Middleware:</b>
      Acts as a bridge between different software applications or components.<br />
      Examples include database management systems (DBMS) and web servers.<br /><br />
      <b>6. Embedded Software:</b> Runs on specialized hardware devices and
      controls their functions.<br />
      Examples include firmware in mobile phones, microwave ovens, and digital
      cameras.

    <h2>Q.3 What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC.</h2>
    <p>
      <b>SDLC</b> stands for <b>Software Development Life Cycle</b>. It's a
      process followed by software developers to design, <br />develop, test,
      and deploy software efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Planning:</b> Define project goals, scope, and requirements.
      Identify risks and create a project plan. <br /><br />
      <b>2. Analysis:</b> Gather and analyze requirements from stakeholders.
      Understand what the software needs to do and how it will be used.
      <br /><br />
      <b>3. Design:</b> Create a blueprint for the software based on the
      requirements. Design the system architecture, user interface, and database
      structure.<br /><br />
      <b>4. Implementation:</b> Write, code, and develop the software based on
      the design specifications. This phase involves actual programming.<br /><br />
      <b>5. Testing:</b> Verify that the software meets requirements and
      functions correctly. Identify and fix any bugs or issues. <br /><br />
      <b>6. Deployment:</b> Release the software to users or clients. Install
      and configure the software in the production environment.<br /><br />
      <b>7. Maintenance:</b> Provide ongoing support, updates, and enhancements
      to the software. Fix bugs, add new features, and ensure it remains
      functional over time.

    <h2>Q.4 What is DFD? Create a DFD diagram on Flipkart.</h2>
    <p>
      <b>DFD</b> stands for Data Flow Diagram. DFDs are commonly used in
      software engineering to<br />
      model the processes involved in a system and the data flowing between
      them.<br />
      A DFD typically consists of processes (functions), data stores, data flows
      (pipes), and external entities.<br /><br />
